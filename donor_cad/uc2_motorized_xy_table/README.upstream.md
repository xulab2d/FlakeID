# openUC2 *Motorized XY Table*
---

__keywords__: Stepper motors, Arduino, Python, Freecad, 3D printing


The goal of this project is to convert a manual microscope stage into a motorized one that can be used with the UC2 system.
The stage is controlled through a common GRBL (i.e. 3D printer/CNC) interface and also integrates into the [ImSwitch](https://github.com/beniroquai/ImSwitch/tree/master/imswitch) software to control complex microscopy setups.
The precision of displacement approaches the micrometer. 
This repo is a fork from the [SonyCSLParis](https://github.com/SonyCSLParis/Motorized-stage) group.

All necessary parts besides the motors and the stage can be 3D printed. The overall price is ~200€.


***Features:***

The knobs initially used to manually move the platform are linked to motors via 2 belt-pulley systems (X and Y displacements). One removable part of the platform is replaced by a 3D-printed part that allows to fix the two motors. The pulleys are also 3D-printed to fit on the knobs. 

* Interact with it using GRBL/GCode
* large-scale microscopy slide scanning 
* easy to build 
* simple to automate

# Software

The stage is drive by 2 NEMA 17 stepper motors. For this we use a simple Arduino + CNC Shield v3. We don't want to specify the correct usage of the code here as there are many tutorials for how to interact with stepper motors and Arduino through e.g. Python. A more in-depth tutorial can be found in our [UC2-Hi2 APP](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-Hi2) that makes use of the Makerbase MKS board and a customized PYTHON Interface. 
If you need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to us! 

# Hardware

Below we describe how the device can be build and assembled in order to replicate the whole system as shown in the rendering above. One needs additional parts that can be found in the core [openUC2 repository](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT).

***FROM THE ORIGINAL FORK:***

# Results 

In the end we were able to control the movement of the stage to go from one trap to the following one. The following animation shows a trap and its neighbour appearing one after the other in the center of the camera.

</p>  


By using the EasyDriver we could rotate each motor by one microstep. In the end the set-up enabled us to reach a minimal movement of 1,95 μm along the **x** axis and of 0,05 μm along the **y** axis.

In order to estimate the quality of our set-up, we measured its precision using the registration method which calculates the spatial correlation between two successive IMAGES.

On the one hand the analyses of these results shows that the stage moves linearly along the **y** axis as expected. We concluded that our set-up was of good quality for this direction.

<p align="center">
<img src="IMAGES/deplacement_y.png" width="400"/>
</p>

On the other hand we discovered that the movement along the **x** axis is flawed. Indeed when moving the stage along this axis we regularly measure a small unwanted movement along the **y** axis. This shortcoming leads to imprecise movement along the **x** axis, and it seems to come from the mechanics of the manual platform.

# Set-up

## 3D Printing

### Pulleys

To link the stepper motors to the stage we had to print two slave pulleys - one for each knob. We did that using the free and open-source design and modeling software FreeCAD. We first wanted to design these slave pulleys so that moving the stepper motors by one microstep would move the stage by 5 μm.

We determined that one turn of the **y**-axis knob moves the stage by 4 cm. Knowing that the master pulley has 20 teeth and that with the Nema motors we can split one revolution into 1600 steps, we calculated that the **y**-axis slave pulley needed to have 100 teeth. 

We first tested with a simple Nema 17 motor but the couple was not sufficient to move the platform. Therefore we opted for a Nema coupled with a gearbox with 100:1 ratio, multiplying the couple by 100. This motor moved the platform without any issue. 




<p align="center">
<img src="IMAGES/pulley.png" width=300"/>
</p>

For the **x**-axis we measured that one turn of the knob moves the stage by 2,5 cm. In the case of the **x** axis the 17HM08-1204S stepper motor has 3200 microsteps per revolution and the master pulley has 20 teeth. Thus we calculated that the **x**-axis slave pulley needed to have 32 teeth. Such a little number of teeth leads to modeling issues.

Thus we decided to design an 80 teeth slave pulley for the **x**-axis knob. This leads to a higher precision : when the stepper motor rotates by 1 microstep, the stage moves by 1,95 μm along the **x** axis (with a simple Nema 17 motor)



## Assembly

In order to keep things simple we decided to control both stepper motors with one Arduino UNO microcontroller. We still had to use one EasyDriver microcontroller for each stepper motor. We used [Brian Schmalzhaus' example](https://www.schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/Examples/EasyDriverExamples.html) running multiple stepper motors. The set-up can be seen in the following diagram. As we wanted precise movements, we enabled microstepping control for both motors by adding connections between the MS1 and MS2 pins and the ground for each EasyDriver microcontroller.
